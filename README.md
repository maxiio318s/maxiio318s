Hi, this repo is my practice analyzing a set of sample databases. It contains the following as below:

### 1 / SQL code
      - PortfolioSQL.sql
### 2/ Visualize by Looker Studio (Google Data Studio)
      - App Install Report
      - Food & Beverage Sales Analysis Dashboard.
      - Retail - Performance Dashboard Report PBI

### 3/ Python Code (On going)

### 4/ Dashboard built by Tableau (On going)

Thanks for having a look!
